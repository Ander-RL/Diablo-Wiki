        Since then I\'ve tried to forget the terrors I beheld beneath the cold earth, and the twisted nightmares that have haunted my every waking moment.

        Though I know the way, I know not what perils will arise to hinder my journey, and as I pass through the first gate,
        I know that the better part of my soul will remain behind… forever.\" \n\n— The Dark Wanderer </string>
